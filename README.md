# SMHI Open Data for Dart
*This package is in early development and some features may not work as intended. If so, feel free to [submit a pull request][pullRequest].*

A Dart package for usage of the [Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute's Open Data API][smhiDocs].
The API allows you to get the weather and other meterological data like air temperature & pressure.
At the time of writing this, the Meteorological Forecasts API is available in the following countries:
- Sweden
- Norway
- Finland
- Denmark
- Estonia

And partly:
- Latvia
- Lithuania

## Usage

This example shows how to get the air temperature at this time tomorrow in Stockholm:
```dart
import 'package:smhi/smhi.dart';

final MeteorologicalForecasts meteorologicalForecasts = MeteorologicalForecasts();
// Your request will automatically be cached. So if you make the same one again, it will return the cached version.
final Forecast? forecast = await meteorologicalForecasts.forecast(GeoPoint(59.334591, 18.063240));
if (forecast != null) {
	// Forecasts are divided into moments where each moment represents a date & time.
	// Read more at SMHI's documentation: https://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/metfcst/get-forecast.html
	final ForecastMoment moment = forecast.momentWhen(DateTime.now().add(const Duration(days: 1)));
	print(moment.valueOf(MetFcstParameter.airTemperature));
}
```
